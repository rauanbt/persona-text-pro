      question: "How does SapienWrite work?",
      answer: "SapienWrite uses advanced natural language processing to rewrite AI-generated text, making it sound more human while applying your chosen tone (Regular, Casual, Formal, Funny, Sarcastic, or Smart). Our system analyzes patterns that AI detectors flag and replaces them with more natural alternatives."
    },
    {
      question: "Does SapienWrite bypass AI detection tools?",
      answer: "Yes! Our system is specifically designed to bypass all major AI detection tools including GPTZero, Copyleaks, ZeroGPT, and many others. We continuously test against these tools and update our algorithms to maintain effectiveness."
    },
    {
      question: "How much does SapienWrite cost?",
      answer: "We offer a free plan with 1,500 words per month (250 words per request). Our Wordsmith plan is $24.95/month (or $17.47/month annually) for 15,000 words, and Master is $54.95/month (or $38.47/month annually) for 30,000 words. Annual plans save you 30% - Wordsmith at $209.64/year and Master at $461.64/year."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the different tone options?",
      answer: "We offer 6 distinct tones: Regular (professional and natural), Casual (relaxed and conversational), Formal (structured and polished), Funny (light-hearted and humorous), Sarcastic (witty and sharp), and Smart (sophisticated and intellectual). Each tone maintains the humanization while adding personality to your content."
    },
    {
      question: "What languages does SapienWrite support?",
      answer: "SapienWrite supports over 50 languages for Wordsmith and Master plans, while the free plan supports English. All tone options work across all supported languages for a truly global experience."
    },
    {
      question: "I want to humanize a long essay. Is it possible?",
      answer: "Yes! Depending on your plan, you can process from 1,500 words per month (free) to 30,000 words per month (Master). For longer documents, you can process them in chunks or upgrade to a higher plan. You can also purchase extra word packages (5,000 for $12.99, 10,000 for $22.99, or 25,000 for $49.99) that never expire."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I see my previous humanizations?",
      answer: "Yes, all paid plans include a dashboard where you can view your processing history, download previous results, and track your monthly usage across all tone options."
    },
    {
      question: "What is your refund policy?",
      answer: "We offer a 3-day money-back guarantee. You can request a full refund within 72 hours (3 days) of your initial purchase for any reasonâ€”no questions asked. Simply contact support at contact@sapienwrite.com. After the 3-day window, cancellations are allowed but are not eligible for refunds. You'll retain full access until your billing period ends."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I cancel my subscription?",
