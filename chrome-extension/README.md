3. Save as PNG files:
   - `icon-16.png`
   - `icon-48.png`
   - `icon-128.png`

**Quick icon generation tips:**
- Use [Figma](https://figma.com) or [Canva](https://canva.com) for design
- Keep design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Use your brand colors (purple/gradient recommended)
- Export as PNG with transparent background
